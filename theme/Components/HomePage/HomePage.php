            <h2>Our Conservation Areas</h2>
            <p>We cover seven conservation areas in the heart of historic London as an advisory committee, comprising all of Camden's Central London area, with the exception of Hatton Garden. Many of our conservation areas are children of the Bloomsbury Conservation Area or are in some way related to it.</p> 
            <p>We are consulted with on all changes to our conservation areas, and report on planning breaches in the area, while also supporting residents in heritage-based objections to applications in their neighbourhood.</p>
